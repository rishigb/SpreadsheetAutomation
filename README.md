# SpreadsheetAutomation

Aim is to send an email when a form is submitted. Simple isn't it? Well, google's scipt example doesn't work. [Here](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/articles/expense_report_approval) is the link to the that.

I have made a lot of changes, you will see some of them here.

What's happening inside:

* <s> Email is sent to the manager the moment a form is submited.</s>

* <s> Email includes a link to approval from the manager.</s>

*<s> When the manager approves or rejects, the filed in the spreadsheet is updated. </s>

*<s> If 3 doesn't happen, another field called submitted is updated. </s>

*<s> Based on the status in column for approval or reject, the email is sent back to employee saying that the request has been submitted.</s>
